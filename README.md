## Project Summary

This project, created by The Odin Project, is a simple inventory management application for an imaginary art store. _InventoryMate_ contains categories and items, which are data that the user can create, read, update, or delete (CRUD). Following a similar structure to that of the [MDN's Express Local Library tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Tutorial_local_library_website), this project demonstrates a solid introduction to creating and running an application using Node and Express as well as the following topics:

- `express-generator`
  - Use `express-generator` to create a skeleton website to populate with site-specific routes, templates/views, and database calls.
- View templates with EJS
  - Use EJS to insert variables and logic into the application's views and manage asynchronous operations in controller functions.
- CRUD and MVC
  - Use the CRUD method to design an interface that allows users to create, read, update, and delete data as well as use models, views, and controllers (MVC) to organize application logic.
- Using a database (MongoDB with Mongoose)
  - Design models and schemas to populate the database and interact with.
- Routes
  - Create routes by defining URLs that return specific resources and views to display pages.
- Forms and validation
  - Work with HTML forms using EJS, validate and sanitize data using `express-validator`, and write forms that enable the CRUD method.
- Deployment
  - Learn how to prepare an application for production by improving security and performance.
